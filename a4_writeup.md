# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The hardest part was figuring out the "has won" function. Figuring out all the ways in which someone could win + how to turn that into code was fairly difficult.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
Have them enter in a random spot, there would likely need to be some sort of way for the computer to check to see if the spot is already taken.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
Maybe have a way for the computer to check to see if they're a step away from victory or loss. I'm not exactly sure how we'd implement steps to get the computer to make the proper steps in the early stages of the game, as telling them to be 1 step away wouldn't work in the beginning portions.
